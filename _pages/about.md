About me
======
Hi there! This is Yuan Xue (薛源), a Ph.D. candidate in physics at The University of Texas at Austin, working with [Matteo Ippoliti](https://matteoippoliti.com/).

My interests lie in a broad range of topics in theoretical physics. Currently, I am focusing on: 

* Open quantum systems, mixed-state phases of matter, and numerical simulations.
* Multipartite entanglement and anomaly.
* Generalized symmetries, symTFT, and TQFT
* Classification of fracton orders.

During October, I will participate in the KITP program: [Learning the Fine Structure of Quantum Dynamics in Programmable Quantum Matter](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/finestructure25).
