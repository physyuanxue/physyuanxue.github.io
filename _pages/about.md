About me
======
Hi there! This is Yuan Xue (薛源), a physics Ph.D student at The University of Texas at Austin. I am working with [Matteo Ippoliti](https://matteoippoliti.com/) and [Eslam Khalaf](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/khalaf). 
My interests lie in a broad range of topics in theoretical physics. Currently, I am focusing on non-invertible symmetries, fracton topological orders, quantum error correction and Moiré physics.
